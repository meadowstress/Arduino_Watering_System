==============

The build folder on top level is needed for the arduino build files and the build folder in src/build for cmake!

The build folder for the arduino has to be declared in the arduino.json configuration file.
The path to the arduino installation files has to be specified in the arduino settings or in the c_cpp_properties.json directly
